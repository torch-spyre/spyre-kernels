# Spyre Kernel Conversion Skill

Convert a GPU-shaped Triton kernel (`original.py`) into a Spyre-aware kernel
(`spyre.py`) that satisfies the authoring invariants for IBM Spyre/AIU.

This **builds on the tensor-descriptor conversion** (`td-convert`): first the
memory accesses become descriptors, then this skill adds the Spyre-specific
distribution, scratchpad, and gap handling. If you only need the descriptor port
(no invariants), use `td-convert`.

## Trigger

Use when asked to convert a kernel to Spyre-aware form, port a kernel to Spyre,
or produce a `spyre.py` from an `original.py`.

## Pre-flight

Run the KB consult in [`../_shared/preflight.md`](../_shared/preflight.md).

## Inputs

- **kernel_name**: directory under `kernels/`
- Source: `kernels/<name>/original.py`
- Output: `kernels/<name>/spyre.py`, kernel `_<name>_kernel_spyre`

## The invariants

Every Spyre-aware kernel must satisfy the invariants in
[`../_shared/invariants/`](../_shared/invariants/) — one file each. **Read that
directory** and apply every file you find; the set may grow or shrink, so do not
rely on a fixed list here.

## Procedure

1. **Descriptors first.** Apply
   [`../_shared/descriptor-rules.md`](../_shared/descriptor-rules.md) in full —
   replace pointer arithmetic, drop redundant masks, respect the 16-byte
   minimum. (Same as `td-convert` step 1–3.)

2. **Satisfy every invariant.** Read
   [`../_shared/invariants/`](../_shared/invariants/) and apply each file's rule
   and canonical pattern — do not work from a fixed list, as the set may change.
   Typical work this entails: replacing the unbounded GPU grid with a
   `tl.program_id` / `tl.num_programs` distribution loop, using fixed constexpr
   tiles with a loop over the dim (never `BLOCK = next_power_of_2(N)`), and
   keeping problem sizes as runtime args with `tl.cdiv` / `tl.minimum` tail
   handling. The invariant files are authoritative for the details.

3. **Strip `@triton.autotune`** and other GPU-only helpers (`tl.assume`,
   `tl.multiple_of`, CUDA/HIP config). *Why autotune specifically:* on GPU,
   autotune times each `BLOCK_*` config and caches the fastest per key — it
   relies on GPU-style tight kernel-launch timing. Spyre does not work that way:
   tile sizes interact with the 2 MB scratchpad budget and OpSpec-level
   scheduling (LoopSpec, tiled_symbols, device_size), so the right sizes come
   from compiler-level analysis, not random search. (Read this as a hard
   constraint, not a style preference.)

4. **Preserve the signature when possible** so the wrapper can call both forms
   with minimal branching. Recover grid-derived values from existing args
   before adding parameters; update the wrapper if you must add any.

5. **Utilize the scratchpad — batch work items.** After the single-item
   conversion, evaluate whether the distribution loop processes one item per
   iteration with a small accumulator. If so, batch `BLOCK_ITEMS` per iteration
   per [`../_shared/spyre/scratchpad-batching.md`](../_shared/spyre/scratchpad-batching.md).
   This also documents the **16-byte escape** (a scalar load widened to a
   `[BLOCK_ITEMS]` vector clears the minimum) and the divergent-control-flow
   masking trade-off.

6. **Handle Spyre-compiler descriptor gaps the right way.** Write the cleanest
   descriptor-first form even if it does not compile yet; if it hits a gap,
   **mark the site with a `# [gap]` annotation** rather than baking a workaround
   into the kernel. See [`../_shared/spyre/gap-handling.md`](../_shared/spyre/gap-handling.md)
   for the annotation contract and the live sources (KB, `torch-spyre/triton`
   issues/docs) where the current gaps are tracked, so the target form is clear
   once the compiler catches up.

## Layout awareness (write logical; annotate the physical layout with a marker)

Write descriptors in **logical** shape — the tensor's math dimensions — see the
worked [`../_shared/examples/matmul-logical.md`](../_shared/examples/matmul-logical.md).
You do **not** hand-write the physical device layout in the shape/strides; the
compiler tiles it.

> When a tensor is stick-tiled, make the physical layout **explicit** with a
> `tl.spyre_tensor_layout` marker on its descriptor. The descriptor stays
> logical; the marker declares the stick factoring; the compiler's
> `RewriteDescriptorLayout` pass synthesizes the physical loops. `tl.dot` is
> untouched and there is **no** reshape glue (contrast the physical variant).

For each stick-tiled descriptor, immediately after constructing it:

```python
a_desc = tl.make_tensor_descriptor(a_ptr, shape=[M, K], strides=[K, 1],
                                    block_shape=[BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K])
tl.spyre_tensor_layout(a_desc, [(0, "floordiv", 64), 1, (0, "mod", 64)])  # stick-on-M
```

- **One entry per physical dim**, in the order `[stick-index, other…, lane]`.
  Convention: `stick-on-X` → `[(X, "floordiv", S), other, (X, "mod", S)]`. Bare
  int = identity on that logical dim; `(src,"floordiv",S)` = stick index;
  `(src,"mod",S)` = within-stick lane.
- **`src` is the logical dim index** being stick-tiled (K for `A[M,K]` is dim 1;
  K for `B[K,N]` is dim 0 — same-looking markers name different axes).
- **`S = 128 // dtype_bytes`** (64 fp16/bf16, 32 fp32, 128 fp8) — not hard-coded.
- **Stickified extents must be multiples of `S`.** A ragged split silently
  produces an out-of-bounds physical view (not diagnosed) — pad on the host, and
  say so in the conversion notes. A stick dim's *block* extent may not be
  sub-stick either.
- **Pass the layout as a `tl.constexpr` kernel arg — not an inline literal.** A
  layout containing stick-split entries *raises* when written inline at the call
  site (`TypeError: int() argument must be ... not 'tuple'`), because the jit
  frontend turns the literal into a `core.tuple` that the parser's builtin-`tuple`
  isinstance check rejects. Binding it to a plain local also fails (the jit tries
  to tensor-convert the `"floordiv"` string). The working form:

  ```python
  def kern(..., A_LAYOUT: tl.constexpr):
      if A_LAYOUT is not None:
          tl.spyre_tensor_layout(a_desc, A_LAYOUT)
  ```
- **Mark the output descriptor** too when the store must scatter into sticks.
- **Mark the memory operands of the tiled op only.** Both sides of a stickified
  contraction axis must be marked, with the same stick size. Leave logical
  intermediates (a softmax result feeding the next `tl.dot`, a scratchpad) and
  elementwise addends (a bias / additive mask) **unmarked**.
- **A transposed operand still gets marked.** Mark it and bring it in with
  `tl.trans` — the pass absorbs the permutation (this is how you write `Q·Kᵀ`),
  and chained transposes compose. A transpose *after* the contraction feeding a
  marked store is preserved instead, so keep it if you need that output order.
- **Markers are not matmul-only** — a marked input to a reduction gets the same
  stick loop.
- **Batched matmul: an identity batch dim.** A descriptor may carry a leading
  batch axis (`[BATCH, M, K]`) — make it an identity dim (a bare `src` int) and
  stick-tile only the inner matmul axis; `tl.dot` over the trailing two dims
  lowers to `linalg.batch_matmul`, covering every batch/head in one launch. Only
  one leading batch dim is dispatched; fold extras on the host.
- **Write enclosing loops in block units.** If a loop IV feeds a marked
  descriptor's stick dim, the pass rescales the loop's bounds *and step* into
  stick units — do not pre-multiply by the stick count yourself.
- **Dynamic extent.** An extent may be a runtime `i32` arg (put it in `shape`
  only; `strides`/`block_shape` stay constexpr) so one lowered kernel serves any
  size along that axis.

Which loop structure results (a parallel scatter over an output axis's sticks vs a
K-reduction loop) is a *consequence* of which axes you mark — the compiler assigns
a role per physical dim and derives the loops. See
[`../_shared/spyre/tensor-layout-marker.md`](../_shared/spyre/tensor-layout-marker.md)
for the full coordinate-map reference, the verifier's diagnostics, and the
`data_layout` / `required_fixes` lowering options.

> **Dependency:** `tl.spyre_tensor_layout` requires the `torch-spyre/triton`
> build (not stock PyPI Triton). KTIR generation is pinned to that build, and
> that pin is coupled to the `ktir-cpu` rev — see
> [`../_shared/spyre/tensor-layout-marker.md`](../_shared/spyre/tensor-layout-marker.md).

## Document the conversion

After writing the kernel, record what changed in
`kernels/<name>/conversion-notes.md` — the single file shared with `td-convert`.
Append a `## Spyre-aware conversion` section; if `td-convert` already wrote a
`## Tensor-descriptor conversion` section, leave it intact and add yours below.
Create the file with both headings if it does not exist yet.

```markdown
# <name> conversion notes

## Tensor-descriptor conversion
- (written by td-convert, if it ran — leave intact)

## Spyre-aware conversion

- Source: original.py → spyre.py
- Invariants: <key per-invariant decisions, e.g. which axis is the distribution loop>
- Scratchpad batching: <BLOCK_ITEMS choice and why, or "none — already dense">
- Gaps: <gap sites + `# [gap]` annotation, or "none">
- <any signature change or other non-obvious decision>
```

Keep it short — the *why* behind non-obvious choices, not a line-by-line diff.
